    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Google IT Support, Cybersecurity, and UX/UI Design certified. I am
      currently enrolled in the Udemy web developer bootcamp with Dr. Angela Yu.
      I enjoy working out problems and having all the pieces fall into place. I
      also appreciate the time it takes to learn new skills and don't shy away
      from a challenge. There is no better feeling than fixing any software or
      hardware issues that keep you from working after spending what feels like
      an eternity troubleshooting. I am a Delete the Divide Intern with LA
      County and help the public with base IT situations in a library setting. I
      also have three years of customer service experience, data collection, and
      reception skills from the veterinary industry. I am grateful for the
      opportunities presented to me by Delete the Divide and hope to continue to
      learn as many skills as I can.
